<p align="justify"><b><i>Concerning Choice and Avoidance</i></b></p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="1"></a><b>1)</b> Freedom from trouble in the mind
and from pain in the body are static pleasures, but joy and exultation are
considered as active pleasures involving motion.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>Problems</i></b></p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="2"></a><b>2) </b>Will the wise man do things that
laws forbid, knowing that he will not be found out? A simple answer is not easy
to find.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>The Shorter Summary</i>, a.k.a. <i>The</i> <i>Little
Epitome</i></b></p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="3"></a><b>3) </b>Prophecy does not exist, and even
if it did exist, things that come to pass must be counted nothing to us.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>Against Theophrastus</i></b></p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="4"></a><b>4)&nbsp; </b>But even apart form this argument
I do not know how one should say that things in the dark have color.<a HREF="#*"><sup>*</sup></a></p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>Symposium</i></b></p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="5"></a><b>5) </b>Polyaenus: &quot;Do you, Epicurus,
deny the existence of the warmth produced by wine?&quot; Someone interrupted:
&quot;It does not appear that wine is unconditionally productive of heat.&quot;
(And a little later:) &quot;It seems that wine is unconditionally productive of
heat, but wine of a certain quantity might be said to produce heat in a certain
body.&quot;</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="6"></a><b>6) </b>Therefore we must not speak of wine
as unconditionally productive of heat, but rather say that a certain quantity of
wine will produce heat in a certain body which is in a certain disposition, or
that a different quantity will produce cold in a different body. For in the
compound body of wine there are certain particles out of which could might be
produced, if, as need arises, united with different particles they could form a
structure which could cause cold. So that those are deceived who say that wine
is unconditionally heating or cooling.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="7"></a><b>7) </b>Wine often enters the body without
exerting any power either of heating or of cooling, but when the structure is
disturbed and an atomic rearrangement takes place, the atoms which create heat
at one time come together and by their number give heat and inflammation to the
body, at anther they retire and so cool it.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="8"></a><b>8) </b>Sexual intercourse has never
benefited a man, and he is lucky if it has not harmed him.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="9"></a><b>9) </b>It is strange indeed that you were
not at all impeded by your youth, as you would say yourself, from attaining,
young as you were, a distinction in the art of rhetoric far above all you
contemporaries, even the experienced an famous. It is strange indeed, I say,
that you were not at all impeded by your youth from winning distinction in the
art of rhetoric, which seems to require much practice and habituation, whereas
youth can be an impediment to the understanding of the true nature of the world,
towards which knowledge might seem to contribute more than practice and
habituation.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>On the Goal of Life</i></b></p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="10"></a><b>10) </b>I do not know how I can conceive
the good, if I withdraw the pleasures of taste, withdraw the pleasures of love,
withdraw the pleasures of hearing, and withdraw the pleasurable emotions caused
by the sight of a beautiful form.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="11"></a><b>11) </b>The stable condition of
well-being in the body and the sure hope of its continuance holds the fullest
and surest joy for those who can rightly calculate it.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="12"></a><b>12) </b>Beauty and virtue and the like
are to be honored, if they give pleasure; but if they do not give pleasure, we
must bid them farewell.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>On Nature</i></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>Book I</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="13"></a><b>13)</b> The nature of the universe
consists of bodies and void.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="14"></a><b>14) </b>The nature of all existing things
is bodies and space.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>Book XI</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="15"></a><b>15) </b>For if it [the sun] had lost its
size through the distance, much more would it have lost its color: for there is
no other distance better adapted for such loss than that of the sun.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>From Uncertain Works</i></b></p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="16"></a><b>16) </b>The atom is a hard body free from
any admixture of void; the void is intangible existence.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="17"></a><b>17) </b>Away with them all: for he [Nausiphanes],
like many another slave, exerted himself with that sophistic boasting.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="C"></a><font SIZE="+1">Remains of Letters</font>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="18"></a><b>18) </b>If they have this in mind, they
are victorious over the evils of want and poverty.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="19"></a><b>19) </b>Even if war comes, he would not
count it terrible, if the gods are propitious. He has led and will lead a pure
life in Matro’s company, by favor of the gods.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="20"></a><b>20) </b>Tell me, Polyaenus, do you know
what has been a great joy to us?</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Letters to Several Persons</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>To the Philosophers in Mytilene</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="21"></a><b>21) </b>This drove him [Nausiphanes] to
such a state of fury that he abused me and ironically called me <i>Master</i>.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="22"></a><b>22) </b>I suppose that those grumblers
will believe me to be a disciple of The Mollusk [Nausiphanes] and to have
listened to his teaching in company with a few hard-drinking youths. For indeed
the fellow was a bad man and his habits, as such, could never lead to wisdom.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Letters to Individuals</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>To Anaxarchus</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="23"></a><b>23) </b>I summon you to continuous
pleasures and not to vain and empty virtues which have but a desperate hope for
rewards.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>To Apelles</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="24"></a><b>24) </b>I congratulate you, Apelles, in
that you have approached philosophy free from all corruption.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>To Themista</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="25"></a><b>25) </b>If you two don’t come to me, I
am capable of being persuade to rush on my own to wherever you and Themista
summon me.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>To Idomenus</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="26"></a><b>26) </b>Send us therefore offerings for
the sustenance of your sacred body on behalf of yourself and your children: this
is how it occurs to me to put it.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="27"></a><b>27) </b>Oh thou, who from youth has
regarded all my prompting as sweet.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="28"></a><b>28) </b>If you wish to make Pythocles
rich, do not give him more money, but diminish his desire.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="29"></a><b>29) </b>We think highly of frugality not
that we may always keep to a cheap and simple diet, but as a means to keep us
free from hunger.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="30"></a><b>30) </b>On this truly happy day of my
life, while at the point of death, I write this to you. The disease in my
bladder and stomach are pursuing their course, lacking nothing of their natural
severity: but against all this is the joy in my heart at the recollection of my
conversations with you. Do you, as I might expect form your devotion from boy
hood to me and to philosophy, take good care of the children of Metrodorus.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>To Colotes</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="31"></a><b>31) </b>In your feeling of reverence for
what I was then saying you were seized with an unaccountable desire to embrace
me and clasp my knees and show me all the signs of homage paid by men in prayers
and supplications to others; so you made me return all these proofs of
veneration and respect to you. Go on thy way as immortal and think of us too as
immortal.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>To Leontion (aka Leontium)</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="32"></a><b>32) </b>Lord and Savior, my dearest
Leontion, what a hurrahing you drew from us, when we read aloud your dear
letter.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>To Pythocles</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="33"></a><b>33) </b>Launch your boat, oh blessed
youth, and flee at full speed from every form of culture.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="34"></a><b>34) </b>I shall sit down and await your
lovely and godlike appearance.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Letters to Uncertain Persons</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>To a Boy or Girl</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="35"></a><b>35) </b>We have arrived at Lampsacus safe
and sound—Pythocles, Hermarchus, Ctesippus and I—and there we found Themista
and our other friends all well. I hope you too are well and your mamma, and that
you are always obedient to Papa and Matro, as you used to be. Let me tell you
that the reason that I and all the rest of us love you is that you are always
obedient to them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>Letter Written in His Last Days</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="36"></a><b>36) </b>A week before writing this, the
stoppage became complete and I suffered pains such as bring men to their last
day. If anything happens to me, do you look after the children of Metrodorus for
four or five years, but do not sped any more on them than you now spend each
year on me.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><b><i>Letters Written to Unknown Recipients</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="37"></a><b>37) </b>I am thrilled with pleasure in
the body, when I live on bread and water, and I spit upon luxurious pleasures
not for their own sake, but because of the inconveniences that follow them.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="38"></a><b>38) </b>As I told you when you were going
away, take care also of his brother Apollodorus. He is not a bad boy, but causes
me anxiety, when he does what he does not mean to do.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="39"></a><b>39) </b>Send me a pot of cheese, so that
I may have a feast when I care to.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="40"></a><b>40) </b>You have looked after me
wonderfully generously in sending me food, and have given proofs heaven-high of
your good will to me.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="41"></a><b>41) </b>The only contribution I require
is that which … ordered the disciples to send me, even if they are among the
Hyperboreans. I wish to receive from each of you two hundred and twenty drachmae
a year and no more.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="42"></a><b>42) </b>He shall realize a valuable
return in the instruction which I have given him.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="43"></a><b>43) </b>I never desired to please the
rabble. What pleased them, I did not learn; and what I knew was far removed from
their understanding.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="44"></a><b>44) </b>Do not think it unnatural that
when the flesh cries out, the soul cries too. The flesh cries out to be saved
from hunger, thirst, and cold. It is hard for the soul to repress these cries,
and dangerous for it to disregard nature’s summons, because the soul
accustomed to independence day by day.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="45"></a><b>45) </b>The man who follows nature and
not groundless opinions is independent of all things. For in reference to what
is enough for nature, every possession is riches—but in reference to unlimited
desires, even the greatest wealth [is not riches but poverty].</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="46"></a><b>46) </b>Your anxiety is directly
proportional to your forgetfulness of nature, for you bring on yourself
unlimited fears and desires.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="47"></a><b>47) = <a HREF="Vatican_Sayings.html#XIV">Vatican
Saying XIV</a></b></p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="48"></a><b>48) </b>It is better for you to be free
of fear lying upon a bed of straw, than to have a golden couch and a lavish
table and be full of trouble.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="49"></a><b>49) </b>… remembering your letter and
your discussion about the men who are not able to see the analogy between
phenomena and the unseen nor the harmony which exists between sensations and the
unseen and again the contradiction…</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="50"></a><b>50.</b> Sweet is the memory of a deceased
friend.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="51"></a><b>51) </b>Do not avoid conferring small
favors: for then you will likewise seem to be open to conferring great things.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="52"></a><b>52) </b>If your enemy makes a request to
you, do not scorn his request; but keep on your guard; for he is like a dog.</p>

<p align="justify"><b><i>On Philosophy</i></b></p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="54"></a><b>54) </b>Vain is the word of a philosopher
which does not heal any suffering of man. For just as there is no profit in
medicine if it does not expel the diseases of the body, so there is no profit in
philosophy either, if it does not expel the suffering of the mind.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>Physics</i></b></p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="55"></a><b>55) </b>Nothing new happens in the
universe, as compared to the infinite span of time that has already passed.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="56"></a><b>56) </b>We shall not be considering them
[the gods] any happier or less destructible, if we think of them as neither
speaking nor conversing with one another, but resembling dumb men.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="57"></a><b>57) </b>Let us at least offer pious and
noble sacrifices where it is customary, and let us do all things lawfully while
not troubling ourselves with common beliefs about what concerns the noblest and
holiest of beings. Further, let us be free of any care in regard to their
opinion. Thus, one may live in conformity with nature…</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="58"></a><b>58) </b>If the gods listened to the
prayers of men, all men would quickly have perished: for they are always praying
for evil against one another.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>Ethics</i></b></p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="59"></a><b>59) </b>The beginning and the root of all
good is the pleasure of the stomach; even wisdom and culture must be referred to
this.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="60"></a><b>60) </b>We have need of pleasure when we
suffer pain because of pleasure's absence; but when we are not feeling such
pain, though we are in a condition of sensation, we have no need of pleasure.
For the pleasure which arises from nature does not produce wickedness, but
rather the longing connected with vain fancies.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="61"></a><b>61) </b>That which creates insuperable
joy is the complete removal of a great evil. And this is the nature of good, if
one can once grasp it rightly and then hold by it, rather than walking about
tediously babbling about the<i> good</i>.<a HREF="#**"><sup>**</sup></a></p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="62"></a><b>62) </b>It is better to endure particular
pains which produce greater satisfactions that we may enjoy. It is well to
abstain from particular pleasures which produce more severe pains so that we may
not suffer them.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="63"></a><b>63) </b>Let us not blame the flesh as the
cause of great evils, nor blame fate for our distresses.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="64"></a><b>64) </b>Great pains will quickly put an
end to life; but chronic pains are not severe.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="65"></a><b>65.</b> Excessive pain will send you to
death.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="66"></a><b>66) </b>Through love of true philosophy,
every troublesome and disturbing desire is ended.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="67"></a><b>67) </b>Thanks be to blessed Nature
because she has made what is necessary easy to supply, and what is not easy
unnecessary.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="68"></a><b>68) </b>It is common to find a man poor
in determining the natural end of life but rich with empty fancies. For no fool
is satisfied with what he has, but is distressed for what he has not. Just as
men with a fever, through the malignancy of their disease, are always thirsty
and desire the most injurious things, so too those whose mind is in an evil
state are always poor in everything and in their greed are plunged into
capricious desires.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="69"></a><b>69) </b>Nothing satisfies the man who is
not satisfied with a little.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="70"></a><b>70) </b>Self-sufficiency is the greatest
of all wealth.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="71"></a><b>71) </b>Most men fear frugality and
through their fear are led to actions most likely to produce fear.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="72"></a><b>72) </b>Many men when they have acquired
riches have not found the escape from their ills but have only exchanged them
for greater ills.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="73"></a><b>73) </b>By means of occupations worthy of
a beast, abundance of riches is heaped up, but a miserable life results.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="74"></a><b>74) </b>Unhappiness comes either through
fear or through vain and unbridled desire: but if a man curbs these, he can win
for himself the blessedness of wisdom.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="75"></a><b>75) </b>It is not deprivation of these
things which is the source of pain; such unnecessary suffering arises from vain
fancies.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="76"></a><b>76) </b>The crude soul is puffed up by
prosperity and cast down by misfortune.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="77"></a><b>77) </b>Nature teaches us to pay little
heed to what fortune brings, and when we are prosperous to understand that we
are unfortunate, and when we are unfortunate not to regard prosperity highly,
and to receive unemotionally the good things which come from fortune and to
range ourselves boldly against the seeming evils which it brings: for all that
the many regard as good or evil is fleeting, and wisdom has nothing in common
with fortune.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="78"></a><b>78) </b>He who least needs tomorrow, will
most gladly greet tomorrow.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="79"></a><b>79) </b>I spit upon the beautiful and
those who vainly admire it, when it does not produce any pleasure.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="80"></a><b>80) </b>The greatest fruit of <i>justice</i> is
peace of mind.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="81"></a><b>81) </b>Laws are made for the sake of the
wise, not to prevent them from inflicting wrong but to secure them from
suffering it.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="82"></a><b>82) </b>Even if they [wrongdoers] are
able to escape punishment, it is impossible to win security by escaping: and so
the fear of the future which always presses upon them does not suffer them to be
happy or to be free from anxiety in the present.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="83"></a><b>83) </b>The man who has attained the
natural end of the human race will be equally good, even when no one else is
present.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="84"></a><b>84) </b>A man who causes fear cannot be
free from fear.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="85"></a><b>85.</b> Happiness and blessedness do not
correlate with abundance of riches, exalted positions, or offices or power, but
with freedom from pain and gentleness of feeling and a state of mind that sets
limits that are in accordance with nature.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="86"></a><b>86) </b>Live in anonymity. [<i>Lathe
biosas</i>.]</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="87"></a><b>87) </b>We must say how best a man will
maintain the natural end of life, and how one will not willingly at first pursue
public office.</p>
