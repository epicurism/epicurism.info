A laud to frankness, the cardinal Epicurean virtue of ''parrhesia'': it is best to speak of natural matters frankly (i.e. in a manner that is void of any [[superstition]]) than to cater to popular beliefs, however false those might be, in order to garner the applause that the multitudes are so ready to confer upon anyone who agrees with their prejudices.

The paradoxical argument is that this, rather anti-populist position the true philosopher ought to assume, ultimately is the one that is indeed beneficial to all people.
