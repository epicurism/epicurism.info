<big>{{Vatican Saying 77}}</big>

== Analysis ==

Despite its extreme brevity, this Saying encapsulates the essence of Epicurean teaching: the benefit of attaining [[self-sufficiency]] (i.e. by applying Epicurus' doctine of the [[desires]]) is nothing less than freedom (from anxiety, thus [[ataraxia]]). Self-sufficiency is therefore not an [[end-goal]] itself (as ascetic idealists would argue), but a means to the ultimate goal of a life ridden of anxiety.

It would have been virtually impossible, within the workings of the Greek language, to say so much in so few words.'><font color='#000000'>77</font></a>&nbsp;</p><br><p><a href='http://wiki.epicurism.info/iurl/index.php?title=Template:GED:' title='13)/→,2:/→,3:/→,4:/[The greatest] fruit [of self-sufficiency] (is)</interlinear>
