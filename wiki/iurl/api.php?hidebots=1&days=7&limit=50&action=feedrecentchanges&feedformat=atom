In order to reach the same stability of sound body, the soul has to think time is not a ''per se'' thing, It must not confine to bodily sensations (soul's pleasures are more important), but make flesh (for example the belly: when it's filled it come back empty, not growing) a behavioral model (homeostasis, that is eternal present) - unaware/unworried of flowing of pleasure and of collation between differently located pleasures, and convince itself by analogical experience that&amp;#160; “Infinite and finite time afford equal pleasure” [P.D. 19: not growing, “not craving what is not present and not scorning what does be”, DRN 3.957] as '''kinetic pleasures''' are equivalent. No stable pleasure without virtue. In spite of deceptive appetizers and drinking aperitif: disgust does arrive.

(partisan)&amp;#160; some conjectural reconstructions of the issue he took against Euclid would be possible. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;A real triangle, made of not elastic points, must have only one indivisible point/minimum &lt;ins class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(''elachiston'') &lt;/ins&gt;on vertex of its angles. A triangle side is a line with two angles. But the other sides&amp;#160; [without one or two angles] “are both smaller&amp;quot;&amp;#160; (therefore “equilateral triangle cannot be built”, Proclus, 214), or each vertex point should be divisible by two, what is against definition of indivisible points/minima (''Taytê tê analogia nomisteon kai to en '''elachiston''' kechrêsthai''; ''Ep. Hrdt'' 58). For instance an equilateral triangle with side three empirical points (to day verified as 'quanta') has a perimeter of six points, not nine. If divided in three each side is one plus two half point, that cannot be. If a triangle is divided in half, one half is a little bit larger.&amp;#160; Are certain points of Euclid anytime further divisible, while the others aren't? In that case all points are irrational/adaptable i.e. analogical (like slide rule), and it should&amp;#160; be said that limits and integrals approach in circumstantial variable speed…&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
