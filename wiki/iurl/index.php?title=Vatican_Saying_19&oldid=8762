<big>{{Vatican Saying 19}}</big>

== Analysis ==

A harsh aphorism against ingratitude: the moment we forget the good times we have had, we instantly "become old". 

While this may be true (and certainly holds together with Epicurean attitudes towards reflecting upon a life well spent with deep gratitude), it contradicts the laudatory notion of old age, as it was articulated in [[Vatican Saying 17]]. Whereas there old age was praised for the serenity it affords us, here it is disparaged as a negative state of vacuity and ingratitude.

The two are not, however, necessarily contradictory. Schopenhauer claimed that the expression most often seen on the faces of old people was disappointment'><font color='#000000'>19</font></a>&nbsp;</p><br><p><a href='http://wiki.epicurism.info/iurl/index.php?title=Template:GED:' title='13)/→,2:/→,3:/(The one) who has forgotten,4:/[past] good (experiences),5:/[has become] old,6:this very day,7:/→</interlinear>

A harsh aphorism against ingratitude: the moment we forget the good times we have had, we instantly "become old". 

While this may be true (and certainly holds together with Epicurean attitudes towards reflecting upon a life well spent with deep gratitude), it contradicts the laudatory notion of old age, as it was articulated in [[Vatican Saying 17]]. Whereas there old age was praised for the serenity it affords us, here it is disparaged as a negative state of vacuity and ingratitude.

</p><p>This is another laud to the beneficial effects of memory, a cardinal value to the Epicurean's happiness. Those who are phisophically cultivated and cherish the fond memories of good times past remain "young" in spirit; those others who strive after continued present pleasures are likely to be disappointed, and thus become "old". On a further, practical consideration: with the limitations old age naturally imposes, it seems a better course of action to recollect past experiences than to chase after new ones.'><font color='#000000'>/→,2:/→,3:/(The one) who has forgotten,4:/[past] good (experiences),5:/[has become] old,6:this very day,7:/→</interlinear>

This is another laud to the beneficial effects of memory, a cardinal value to the Epicurean's happiness. Those who are phisophically cultivated and cherish the fond memories of good times past remain "young" in spirit; those others who strive after continued present pleasures are likely to be disappointed, and thus become "old".

<p>A harsh aphorism against ingratitude: the moment we forget the good times we have had, we instantly "become old". 
</p><p>While this may be true (and certainly holds together with Epicurean attitudes towards reflecting upon a life well spent with deep gratitude), it contradicts the laudatory notion of old age, as it was articulated in <a href="/Vatican_Saying_17" title="Vatican Saying 17">Vatican Saying 17</a>. Whereas there old age was praised for the serenity it affords us, here it is disparaged as a negative state of vacuity and ingratitude.
</p><p>The two are not, however, necessarily contradictory. Schopenhauer claimed that the expression most often seen on the faces of old people was disappointment; it is perhaps that kind of old people, who have apparently forgotten the good times they must certainly have experienced along their long lifetimes, that Epicurus posits as examples to avoid.
</p><p>This is another laud to the beneficial effects of memory, a cardinal value to the Epicurean's happiness. Those who are phisophically cultivated and cherish the fond memories of good times past remain "young" in spirit; those others who strive after continued present pleasures are likely to be disappointed, and thus become "old". On a further, practical consideration: with the limitations old age naturally imposes, it seems a better course of action to recollect past experiences than to chase after new ones.
