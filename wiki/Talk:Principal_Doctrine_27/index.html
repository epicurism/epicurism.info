<p>The intricacies of friendship-chain (polyphilìas, phratrìa) were distributive justice, dissidence of values and sensitivity, unlike understanding capability, circles, competitions and privilege among sectarians. The extensions of Epicureanism led in some cases to unorthodox views. Sage friends did betray the 'immortal' (V.S. 78&nbsp;?) friendship.  <br /> From Philodemus' <i>Pragmateiai</i> it follows that first of all was Athens' Garden: cost like a 37 metre warship with 200 recruit, collected at Lampsachus from 311 to 306 ("thanks to gifts and donations E. succeeded in outpace middle-class" [Polystratus, <i>PHerc 176</i>, Arr 142]; moreover: an house at Melites with a modest garden (cost 1/4 of the former; [see Sen, <i>Epist</i>. 21, 10; Pline, <i>N.H</i>. XIX 4]; a landed property with slaves: and then the other branches: "The improvement of our situation allows not only to divide what is possible, but also to export what is left". But ransoms (Craterus did not content of 10 talents for Mithres freeing, 281 B.C.), magistrate bribes, protection money to local gangs had to be paid ("among the Greeks, apart from other things, members of the government, if they are entrusted with no more than a talent, thought they have ten copyists and as many witnesses, cannot keep their faith" [Polybius, Histories. VI, 56]). "About partnership share (συντάξεις) which I have imposed (120 drachms - silver coins, "the yield of .?. slaves"), I order you to send it even if you lie at hyperborean land!"[Phld.,<i>Pragmateiai</i> (PHerc. 1418 &amp; 310): a sort of friendship somewhat taxed...]. Philodemus stand up for him, but he was in the same boat: "Why shouldn't he (a follower) pay, who was purged of foolishness thanks to him (Epicurus)? " [Phld. On Frank Criticism, fr. 55 Olivieri].<br />
As between very rich figures and art and intellectual members presents were accepted as a recognition of merit, so among fellows presents were ennobled as starting point of trust.But if extended friendships are mostly utilitarian - with good reason, as immoderate unselfishness is self-destructive, and in the long run morally harmful, so: “Do not avoid conferring small favors: for then you will likewise seem to be open to conferring great things” [U214]. Good feelings declarations may go for free in that same direction. Montesquieu is even more deliberate: ”Friendship is a contract with which we engage to do small services, in order that he reciprocate us some big ones” [<i>My way of thinking</i> [1092]. Where business activity stammers, swap grudges. Initial Epicurean realism  (with glosses) implies that thankful friends are they who still have something else to beg for.<br />
Realistically, a philosopher/shrink cannot have unselfish affection for all and forever: he made them pay fees by installment - it would need to work out the total. Nature doesn't point out how much friends  need we. Unrestrained friendliness in large societies may turn  unnatural; and prescriptiveness begins. <br /> 
From Epicurus will, know we that first of all were his household (Aminomachus?, Timocrates?) and Metrodorus' one; except a problematic pupil Nicanor (male). <i>Perì Physeos</i> speaks frequently to Metrodorus, but the latter is always keeping silent/agrees. <i>Dialogismoi</i> and <i>suzêtêsis</i> don't come out in his works so far. As conjectural decisions, lines of research, character-linked value-judgments are properly egalitarian, the know-it-all person is felt unwittingly bossy<br /> 
In all lasting communes is there a prior, thanks to transference and confession' s bonds, otherwise the freeloader and the 'darling' find way, like some young hippies, who were wandering from one to another commune, until his fatigue/bill duty came in, and all  pleaded short of money (scion/owner included).  Scornful smile toward bourgeois mentality (in ancient world: 'avarice') is always yielding to poor 'artists'.<br /> 
In spite of these intricacies,  in slave/metic Greek society, not defender of civil rights (torture, bribery), without hospitals and old-age pensions - even though for rich persons were there servants, clients, namely bodyguards (therefore P.D. VI) - friendship chain' risk (sectarianism, fanaticism, freemasonry, Mafia) was of use, for some people more than anyone else. If a friend was plainly in no position to reciprocate one's help in the future one was convinced he would acquire good reputation for help by other important friends. And the gullible fellow continued acquiring reputation ... <br />For middle class was there extended family with his authoritarianism, narrow mindedness, compulsory arranged marriage. Friendship was and is whether an emotion or a virtue/means.<br /> An approach to friendship more realistic than V.S. is the spurious <i>Letter to Demonicus</i> attributed to rhetor Isocratès. An approach more realistic than Vatican Sayings to friendship is the spurious <i>Letter to Demonicus</i> attributed to rhetorician Isocratès. The real  writer  might be G. Iulius Amynias of Samos, just called Isocratès (IG XII, 6, 293), “Epicurean philosopher and coiner”. An  Inscription in Heraion of Samos, 6 B.C  [BCH 5, 1881] and other records bear witness. The writer reasons under Epicurean terms with a young man not Epicurean: “virtue and wise running of one' s life yields always the most pure and stable pleasures”,  he emphasizes on human relations and friendship importance,  but with prudence.
</p>
<blockquote>As people are delighted by the most tempting  more than by the most wholesome food, so among friends too they mix with the one who is ready to be out with them, not with the one who is warning them.<br /> Don't love a friend in excessive way, but in self controlled. […] Know your fellows from experience: pretend to be in trouble […] Open your heart about not confidential deeds as if they were hush-hush; in case your confidence will be disappointed, you won't be harmed.<br />Speak a problem as though it was of others,  this way you'll know their way of thinking about.</blockquote> 
<p>Matius, a rich and politically neutral Epicurean, though financially damaged by demagogic acts of Caesar, continued being sectarian and friend on principle in dead Caesar' s  memory: “People say one's country are to be put before friendship, but I confess not to have reached such a wisdom ...” [Lett. to Cicero; <i>Fam</i>. XI, 28].  Sect becomes  an equivalent of parental protection, but such as that it emasculates the age of reason. A lonely man is watchful and feels stress to a grater extent, but depression of dependence, disappointments and envy on the other hand decrease. Today, candidly, advantages are lesser, and friendship's desire ought to keep quantitative limit (without proxy choice), otherwise it may be distracting from work or studying, contradicting 'live secluded' , and it will arouse, like in ancient times, mistrust or jealousy to former neglected friends. Aristote's «Listen friends, there are no friends»  possibly means:  to  much friends, no solid friend [Montaigne].
But it is always keeping  into us an old savanna instinct of sharing out prey , and of group security around the camp-fire. "Chatting among other good friends and similar to oneself is source of  inmost pleasure"[Phld.<i>On Gods</i> col. XIII; PHERC. 152/157].
